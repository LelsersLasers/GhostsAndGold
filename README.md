# GhostJump
Some sort of game in pygame


## Stuff

### Format

python -m black --line-length 100 main.py

### Check (for 'compile time' errors)

python -m mypy main.py



## TODO

### Bugs
- Directional check sometimes sends sideways to top?

### Main


- Last score

- 4 different 'colors'
- art, animations, particles
- chests/power ups?

- Play with Class.var (static variables)
- Or maybe a large "state" dict
    - with tiles, player, scrolling, etc
